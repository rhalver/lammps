This package implements the "fix qmmm" command which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix enables LAMMPS to be used in a QM/MM simulation, currently
only in combination with pw.x code from the Quantum ESPRESSO package.

This package uses an external library in lib/qmmm which must be compiled
to create the QM/MM capable hybrid executable.  See the lib/qmmm/README
file and the LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS
accordingly.

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
(akohlmey at gmail.com) with contributions by Mariella Ippolito and
Carlo Cavazzoni at Cineca, Italy.

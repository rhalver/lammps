The ML-PACE package provides the pace pair style,
an efficient implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion
potential (ACE).

ACE is a methodology for deriving a highly accurate classical
potential fit to a large archive of quantum mechanical (DFT) data.
This package was written by Yury Lysogorskiy and others
at ICAMS, the Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation,
Ruhr University Bochum, Germany (http://www.icams.de).

This package requires a library that can be downloaded and built
separately or while building LAMMPS with CMake. See the LAMMPS manual
more information on building LAMMPS with external libraries
using CMake.

is available here:

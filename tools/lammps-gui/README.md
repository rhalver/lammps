LAMMPS-GUI

LAMMPS-GUI is a graphical text editor customized for editing LAMMPS
input files that is linked to the LAMMPS C-library interface.
It used to be included with LAMMPS in this folder, but it is now
hosted in its own git repository at https://github.com/akohlmey/lammps-gui/
and the online documentation is at https://lammps-gui.lammps.org/

It is still possible to compile LAMMPS-GUI together with LAMMPS
and link to it directly.

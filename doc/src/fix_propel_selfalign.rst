Description
"""""""""""

.. versionadded:: TBD

Add a torque to each atom in the group due to a self-alignment toward an
intrinsic orientation. The torque is given by :

.. math::

   \mathbf{\tau}_i = \zeta(\mathbf{e}_i \times \mathbf{v}_i)

where *i* is the particle the torque is being applied to, :math:`\zeta`
is the magnitude of the torque, :math:`\mathbf{e}_i` is the orientation
of the particle, and :math:`\mathbf{v}_i` is its velocity. The
self-alignment term, introduced in :ref:`(Shimoyama1996)
<Shimoyama1996>` with the study of collective motion in systems of
self-propelled particles, is an effective torque arising from
differential drag in asymmetric rigid bodies (see :ref:`(Baconnier2025)
<Baconnier2025>`).


For mode *dipole*, :math:`e_i` is just equal to
the dipole vectors of the atoms in the group. Therefore, if the dipoles
are not unit vectors, the :math:`e_i` will not be unit vectors.

.. note::

   If another command changes the magnitude of the dipole, this force
   will change accordingly (since :math:`|e_i|` will change, which is
   physically equivalent to re-scaling :math:`f_P` while keeping
   :math:`|e_i|` constant), and no warning will be provided by
   LAMMPS. This is almost never what you want, so ensure you are not
   changing dipole magnitudes with another LAMMPS fix or pair
   style. Furthermore, self-propulsion forces (almost) always set
   :math:`e_i` to be a unit vector for all times, so it's best to set
   all the dipole magnitudes to 1.0 unless you have a good reason not to
   (see the :doc:`set <set>` command on how to do this).

For mode *quat*, :math:`e_i` points in the direction of a unit vector,
oriented in the coordinate frame of the ellipsoidal particles, which
defaults to point along the x-direction. This default behavior can be
changed by via the *qvector* keyword.

The optional *qvector* keyword specifies the direction of
self-propulsion via a unit vector (sx,sy,sz). The arguments *sx*, *sy*,
and *sz*, are defined within the coordinate frame of the atom's
ellipsoid. For instance, for an ellipsoid with long axis along its
x-direction, if one wanted the self-propulsion force to also be along
this axis, set *sx* equal to 1 and *sy*, *sz* both equal to zero. This
keyword may only be specified for mode *quat*.

.. note::

   In using keyword *qvector*, the three arguments *sx*, *sy*, and *sz*
   will be automatically normalized to components of a unit vector
   internally to avoid users having to explicitly do so
   themselves. Therefore, in mode *quat*, the vectors :math:`e_i` will
   always be of unit length.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored by this fix for
access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during
:doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.


Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the BROWNIAN package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` doc page for more info.

The keyword *dipole* requires that atoms store torque and angular
velocity (omega) as defined by the :doc:`atom_style sphere <atom_style>`
command, as well as a dipole moment as defined by the :doc:`atom_style
dipole <atom_style>` command which is part of the DIPOLE package.  The
keyword *quat* requires that atoms store torque and quaternions as
defined by the :doc:`atom_style ellipsoid <atom_style>` command.

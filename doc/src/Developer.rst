Information for Developers
==========================

This section describes the internal structure and basic algorithms
of the LAMMPS code. This is a work in progress and additional
information will be added incrementally depending on availability
of time and requests from the LAMMPS user community.

A discussion of software engineering methods applied to LAMMPS over time
and a general outline of the design and maintenance approach by the
LAMMPS developers can be found in the paper `LAMMPS: A Case Study For
Applying Modern Software Engineering to an Established Research Software
Package, <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17117558>` in USRSE'25
conference proceedings.

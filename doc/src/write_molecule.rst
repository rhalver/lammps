Description
"""""""""""

Write the data from a :doc:`molecule template<molecule>` to a file.

The file format is determined by the file name: if the file name ends
in ``.json`` the file will be written `JSON format <https://www.json.org/>`_,
otherwise the file is written in the native LAMMPS file format.

When the molecule template contains multiple data sets, the filename
must contain a '%' character which will be replaced by the data set number
so that each data set can be written to a separate file.

This directory contains the ch5md library, which is bundled with
LAMMPS under its own BSD license; see below.  This library is used
when the H5MD package is included in a LAMMPS build and the dump
h5md command is invoked in a LAMMPS input script.

ch5md : Read and write H5MD files in C
======================================

Copyright (C) 2013-2014 Pierre de Buyl

ch5md is a set of C routines to manipulate H5MD files. H5MD is a file format
specification based on [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) for storing
molecular data, whose development is found at <http://nongnu.org/h5md/>.

ch5md is developed by Pierre de Buyl and is released under the 3-clause BSD
license that can be found in the file LICENSE.

To use the h5md dump style in LAMMPS you need to build LAMMPS with the
CMake build system and include -D PKG_H5MD=yes in the CMake configuration.

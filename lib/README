This directory contains libraries that can be linked to when building
LAMMPS, if particular packages are included in the LAMMPS build.

These directories contain code for the library.  The library itself must
be compiled and linked to LAMMPS to provide functionality used by the
corresponding packages.  This process is included in the process of
compiling LAMMPS with CMake.  Support for building these library and
using them with the traditional process is no longer available.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info.

The libraries in this directory are the following:
